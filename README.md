Level Playing Field is a soccer statistics app that displays results from a parallel universe where Spanish La Liga team budget differentials are much less pronounced. 

It applies a formula to Spanish soccer league results and displays the current and resulting tables.

In order to use the API, a .config file would need to be created.
