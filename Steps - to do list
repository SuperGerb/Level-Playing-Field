1. DONE
Get current league table 
  - get matchday (= number of last match played)
  - display results of last match played by calling getParticularMatch(matchday)

2. DONE but needs to be tested and number of API calls maxed out. LOOK INTO.
Calculate and add results of all matches <= matchday 


  //Continue with worker to do the calculations for the league table

Web Workers is a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code.

You don’t (synchronously) wait for the results of a long-running computation (your own algorithm in a Worker process, a network request, etc.), you carry on with the event loop and let the computation notify you when it is finished.

3. DONE
Display league table of modified results

4. DONE

5. DONE
Order the teams in adjusted League table by decreasing pts 

6.
Display “Loading adjusted league table” with spinner icon until ready to display.

7.
Add a class if the results are different from the non-adjusted league table's results

8.
Write a unit test to check if it’s actually doing the calculations properly

9.
Deal with the issue of maxing out number of API calls (50/minute)! Will become a problem with the adjusted league table.
