1. DONE
Get current league table 
  - get matchday (= number of last match played)
  - display results of last match played by calling getParticularMatch(matchday)

2. UMMM… Even though I’m just calling getParticularMatch for Match 1 in the worker, it is calculating for all the matches! (Which is what I ultimately want, but how is it doing this?) CHECK THIS
Calculate and add results of all matches <= matchday 


  //Continue with worker to do the calculations for the league table

Web Workers is a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code.

You don’t (synchronously) wait for the results of a long-running computation (your own algorithm in a Worker process, a network request, etc.), you carry on with the event loop and let the computation notify you when it is finished.
